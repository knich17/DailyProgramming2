## Problem Description
This challenge is inspired by the well-known horse racing puzzle. In that puzzle, you need to find the fastest 3 horses out of a group of 25.

However, you can only directly compare values during a "race" in which you take a set of 5 values and sort them. Based on the outcomes of these races, you need to be able to sort the entire list.
